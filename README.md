## Rust Smart Contract with Anchor Framework
This repository contains my solution to the  Rust-based smart contract implemented using the Anchor framework. The smart contract includes functionality to mint a new SPL token and transfer it between two accounts on the Solana blockchain.

Prerequisites
Before deploying and testing the smart contract, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed please:

* Rust and Cargo: Install Rust
* Solana Command Line Tools: Install Solana CLI
# Installation
Clone the repository:
<div> git clone github.com/xenacode-art/Catoff-Solana-Task.git </div>

## Navigate to the project directory:
 <div>cd to-the-repository </div>

## Build the smart contract:
<div> Build the smart contract :
  cargo build --release
</div>

## Usage
Deploy the smart contract to a local Solana testnet:
anchor deploy


## Test the minting functionality:
anchor test-mint

## Test the token transfer functionality:
arduino
anchor test-transfer

# Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during deployment or testing, refer to the Anchor documentation for troubleshooting tips and solutions,Thank you.
